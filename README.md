# Video Creator Demo

This is a demo application showing how to build advanced video editing apps using the Preview SDK.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Keep in mind that this is an advanced use case, and it is not the best place to start if you do not have any previous experience with Creatomate's Preview SDK. If you are just getting started, please refer to the [Video Preview Demo](https://github.com/Creatomate/video-preview-demo) instead.

## Usage

1. Create a new file called `.env.local` in the root of the project, providing your **API Key** and **Public Token**:

```
CREATOMATE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREATOMATE_PUBLIC_TOKEN=...
```

2. Install all NPM dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

3. The demo can then be run using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Now visit the URL that is displayed in your console, which is by default: `http://localhost:3000`
